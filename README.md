This is a deep learning-based image classifier that detects different types of plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It was developed using TensorFlow, trained in Google Colab, and deployed using Gradio on Hugging Face.

âœ… Built as part of an internship project by **Ansal CM**.

## ðŸ“¥ Download the Trained Model (`.h5`)

GitHub does not support files over 25MB, so the model is hosted externally.

ðŸ”— [Download `image_classifier_model.h5` from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dAlFElq4-0Y_IwzWcY-xLM8x0rS8IYHz)

After downloading, place the file in the **same folder as `app.py`**.

## ðŸ§  How to Run the App Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-classifier.git
cd plant-disease-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
